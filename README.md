## How to add a recipe:
1. Add the `.docx` file in the appropriate folder (`DOCX/desserts/`, `DOCX/ice_creams/`, `DOCX/main_courses/`, or `DOCX/starters/`)
2. Make sure the needed extensions are installed.
3. Run the `build_all.py` script. This will automatially convert to PDF, PNG, HTML, and index to the main page.
